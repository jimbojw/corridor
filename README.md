# corridor

**{json} &rarr; &lt;html&gt; &rarr; {json}**

Bi-directional data binding without the fuss.

## why corridor

Your data is in JSON, but your users interact with HTML.
corridor's singular mission is to shuttle your data between your JSON and your HTML.

It is a runtime library, not a templating language.
corridor runs in the browser, able to transfer your data both ways: from form fields to JSON and back again.

## getting corridor

corridor is a single js file with no dependencies.
You can get it in either of two ways:

* from github: grab [corridor.js](https://github.com/jimbojw/corridor/blob/master/src/corridor.js) out of the [corridor repo](https://github.com/jimbojw/corridor)
* from npm: 

```sh
$ npm install corridor
```

## corridor tutorial

It would be great if users could just edit JSON directly.
That way, your REST API would be all you'd need.

But unfortunately, your users interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) representation of your HTML.
Which means that it's your job to figure out how to get these two views of the data to match.

The corridor library has only one function called `corridor()`.
This function does one of two things:

 * extract data out of a DOM heirarchy (form elements), or
 * insert data into the DOM.

It knows how to shuttle data back and forth by looking at HTML5 data attributes on the DOM elements.

Let's take a look at how this works by using the practical example of a [`package.json`](https://npmjs.org/doc/json.html) file.
We'll build out a single-page web app for manipulating a package.json file.

To skip to the outcome of this walkthrough, see the `example.html` file.

### package.json example app

For a `package.json`, you need at least the following data:

 * name - the name of the project.
 * version - the semantic version number of the project.

And you may also want the following fields:

 * keywords - an array of keywords for npm to find your package.
 * dependencies - a collection of package/version pairs.

In all, that would produce JSON something like this (values omitted):

```js
{
  "name": "",
  "version": "",
  "keywords": [],
  "dependencies": {}
}
```

Now let's put together the UI for working with this data.

### corridor fields

corridor makes it easy to write a UI that controls this data structure.
Let's start with the `name` field.
Here's the HTML you'd need:

```html
<input type="text" data-field='{"name":$$$}' />
```

The `data-field` attribute tells corridor that this `input` provides the value for the `name` property.
The `$$$` token is necessary here, it tells corridor how to insert the value.
Other than the `$$$` token, the `data-field` should contain proper JSON.

Let's try it out.
Make sure you have the `<input>` HTML on a page and the corridor library included.
Then you can call the corridor function with no arguments to extract all the data on the page.

```js
corridor(); // returns {"name":""} (or whatever you've typed in the box).
```

The first argument to corridor is the root element for the data extraction.
If you don't provide one, corridor will assume you meant to search down from the document root.

### corridor data types

By default, corridor will assume that the value provided by a field is a string.
However, you can override this by specifiying a type.

All options to corridor are done by adding a `data-opts` attribute to the node.
Let's see how this applies to the `keywords` field of a package.json.

The corridor HTML for the keywords field looks like this:

```html
<textarea data-field='{"keywords":$$$}' data-opts='{"type":"list"}'></textarea>
```

Here the `type` property indicates that we have a `list` value.
corridor will try to parse the text value of the `<textarea>` as a list of items, and will output an array.

Let's give it a try!
With the above `<textarea>` on a page, enter the text `"abc, def"` (no quotes).
Then run corridor:

```js
JSON.stringify(corridor(), null, 2);
// produces
{
  "name": "",
  "keywords": [
    "abc",
    "def"
  ]
}
```

Supported data types include:

 * string - default, just treats value as a string.
 * boolean - always true or false.
 * number - parses string as a float.
 * list - parses value as a list.
 * json - treats value as valid JSON.

### corridor field nesting

The real strength of corridor emerges when you create nested structures.

For example, say we wanted to have drop-down choices for the `foo` and `bar` dependencies.
The corridor HTML for that would look something like this:

```html
<p data-field='{"dependencies":$$$}'>
  <label>
    foo:
    <select data-field='{"foo":$$$}'>
      <option value="~1.1.0">foo: version 1</option>
      <option value="~2.0.0">foo: version 2</option>
    </select>
  </label>
  <label>
    bar:
    <select data-field='{"bar":$$$}'>
      <option value="~3.5.0">bar: version 3</option>
      <option value="~4.1.0">bar: version 4</option>
    </select>
  </label>
</p>
```

The paragraph element's `data-field` attribute tells corridor that any fields under it should roll up under it when creating the data object.

Running `corridor()` on this gives us:

```js
{
  "dependencies": {
    "foo": "~1.1.0",
    "bar": "~3.5.0"
  }
}
```

Merging works best for objects like the `dependencies` object we just looked at.
But corridor can also merge arrays.

### toggling sections

You can mark sections of your UI as being toggleable using the `role` option in an element's `data-opts`.

For example, say you wanted a checkbox to control whether `keywords` were going to be included in the output.
The corridor HTML for that might look like this:

```html
<div data-opts='{"role":"toggleable"}'>
  <p>
    <label>
      <input type="checkbox" data-opts='{"role":"toggle"}' checked/>
      include keywords?
    </label>
  </p>
  <p>
    <label>
      keywords (list format):
      <textarea data-field='{"keywords":$$$}' data-opts='{"type":"list"}'></textarea>
    </label>
  </p>
</div>
```

Adding the `toggleable` role to the outer `<div>` signals to corridor that this section can be turned on and off.
The checkbox with the role `toggle` controls it.

You can nest toggleable sections inside each other.
In each case, the toggle that control the toggleable container is the nearest child.

### inserting data

Just as corridor can pull data out of the DOM, it can put the data back in as well.
This feature is still a bit experimental, there are some bugs around reinserting arrays (we're working on it).

To insert data back into the DOM, call the corridor function with a root element and a data structure object.

```js
corridor(document.body, {
  name: "foo",
  keywords: ["bar", "baz"]
});
```

corridor uses the same `data-field` and `data-opts` parameters to determine where data values should be inserted.
